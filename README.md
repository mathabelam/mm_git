### Project Title
Udacity USA BikeShare Analysis with Python

### Description
This is my project submission for the Udacity Data Science Programming With Python Nanodegree program. The tool I built is an exploratory data analysis tool that allows the user to analyse the bikesharing activity in his/her city of interest, month of choice,as well as the day - with ability to select all on time filters.

The user interacts with this tool through a terminal and it offers for a user to restart and change his/her filters.
This tool can be useful in many EDA work, including ML projects before building models.
NEXT STEPS: Create a web interface that allows for graphics to be included as part of presenting the insights.
